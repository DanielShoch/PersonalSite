# PersonalSite
Personal Website -- HTML and CSS -- no frameworks

I built this personal website without any frameworks to practice raw HTML and CSS skills. It is live at: danielshoch.com

NOTE: The site is (currently) _not_ adaptive. It wasn't designed with mobile in mind, so it will not look as intended unless the user is on a desktop.
